# OS-SIM
Configuration and detailed explanation of Othogonally Scanning Structured Illumination Microscopy (OS-SIM).
## Introduction
OS-SIM (Orthogonally Scanning-Structured Illumination Microscopy) is a light-sheet based SIM which can enhance the resolution of sample on two orthogonal axis. It is designed and set up for the physics experiment course, and now generate the sinusoidal pattern on cleared brain slice successfully.
